# âœ¨ My Website  

This is my **first attempt at an IndieWeb website**, built with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and a lot of music.

> [!WARNING]
> Since I'm new to the Indieweb, I am well aware that the code isn't up-to-code with the [IndieWeb spec](https://indieweb.org/) (actually, possibly not at all). I will keep working on this.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is a work-in-progress. I'm planning to add a (micro) blog, projects, a proper README & more. Stay tuned!
