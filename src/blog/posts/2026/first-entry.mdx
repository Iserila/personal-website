Hiyaa, welcome to my blog! I'm not entirely sure how much I'll be writing, but we'll see! I'm definitely not a good writer, but I'd like to improve.
As long as this blog sees _some_ use, even if no one reads it, I'll be happy. It will also serve as an archive of my thoughts, ideas, progress etc. 😊

For this first entry, I'd thought I'd be interesting to share what tools I used to build this blog, and the website in general. You could consider this a `/colophon` page?

The website has been built using [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern static site generator.
I have used [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) for my [previous website](https://github.com/Iserila/fyxren.com), and also for the [previous version](https://github.com/Iserila/personal-website/releases/tag/v0.1.0-legacy) of this website, but I found it a bit too much for a static website

I use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling, and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) for writing blog posts. There isn't a CMS involved, but I might explore it in the future.
The website is hosted on the free tier of [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

Honestly, I'm not entirely sold on the design, colors, styling & blog layout. I'm sure I'll improve it over time, but for now, at least it's functional.

Anyway, that's all I have to say for now. I'll be back soon with more!

Have a good one 🩷
